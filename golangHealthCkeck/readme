# why go exec
running system command with node requires child process to be spawned, that comes with and additional memory requirnment.
Unlike the "system" library call from C and other languages, the os/exec package intentionally does not invoke the system shell and does not expand any glob patterns or handle other expansions, pipelines, or redirections typically done by shells. The package behaves more like C's "exec" family of functions.
